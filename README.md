We will copy and paste any code from "SDCProgramming" repository in GitHub to the Arduino IDE to look for errors (the reason for ths is that GitHub dont have an Arduino based library so we wont know our errors untill we run the code on the Arduino IDE)

Each person in the team will be given a part to do depending on experience

If you get stuck on a code, I would like to ask you to google it since you can get your answer faster, but you can also talk to us in our slack group chat and we will help you out

                                                        Schedule:
We will start coding the robot during the middle of november and would like everyone to continue working on the code during the Winter break. We need to get 3/4 of the code done before the Spring semester starts. 

The Spring semester will be the testing phase (aka HELL). Obvious the entire robot wont be finished so we will test each aspect of the robot (signals, motor control, speed, power distribution, etc). We will make a TON of modifications to our code and it can get messy, so hopefull GitHub can makes things clearer

My plan is to get the full code to be done be the first or second month, and leve the remaining semester to run testing to get the numbers right in our code (you will understand what numbers im talking about once we get to the coding)
