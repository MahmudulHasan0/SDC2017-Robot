We will copy and paste any code here to the Arduino IDE to look for errors (obviously).
Each person in the team will be given a part to do depending on experience

If you get stuck on a code, i would say to google it because you will get your answer faster but you can also use slack and we will help out. 

Timeline: 
We will start coding the robot during the middle of november and would like everyone to continue working on the code during the Winter break.
We need to get 3/4 of the code done before the Spring semester begins.

In the Spring semester, we will start the testing process (aka HELL). 
I would like our code to be completed by the first or second month of the term
