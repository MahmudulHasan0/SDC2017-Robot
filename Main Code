Transmitter (the controller) --> Reciever (will be on robot) --> (Digital pin)Arduino(PWM pin) --> ESC (I will worry about this) --> Motors 

                                                        Signal Ranges 
(This part is mostly for me to keep track of the ranges of stuffn)
(Some key ranges that we will use in the future, it might look crazy now, but its very simple stuff): 
Controller values to arduino (0-255 potentiometer) -> Arduino remaps (from 0-255 to 0-180)(servo ranges) -> ESC -> motors
PWM ranges from 1000ms-2000ms for hobby servos 
PWM: analogRead/Write(0-255)
Potentiometer:(0-1023)
