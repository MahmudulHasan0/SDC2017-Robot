/*This will be where the main code will be
We will copy and paste any code here to the Arduino IDE to look for errors (obviously).
Each person in the team will be given a part to focus on depending on experience


Timeline: 
We will start coding the robot during the middle of november and would like everyone to continue working on the code during the Winter break.
We need to get 3/4 of the code done before the Spring semester begins.

In the Spring semester, we will start the testing process (aka HELL)
