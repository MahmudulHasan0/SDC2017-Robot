Information Travel: Transmitter (our controller) --> Reciever onboard robot --> Arduino --> ESC --> Motors

Signal Ranges (Some key ranges that we will use in the future, it might look crazy now, but its simples): 
Controller values to arduino (0-255 potentiometer) -> Arduino remaps from 0-255 to 0-180 (servo ranges) -> ESC -> motors
PWM ranges from 1000ms-2000ms for hobby servos 
PWM: analogRead/Write(0-255)
Potentiometer:(0-1023)
